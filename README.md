# Getting Started
This project was created using React.js and uses Firebase authentication, database, and hosting.\
Once cloned, you will need to use npm i create-react-app to install dependencies.\
You will also need to create a src/firebaseCfg.js and export a Firebase config object containing your Firebase app's config info found in ProjectSettings/General at the bottom.

# Testing

Use 'npm start' to run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Deployment

Use 'firebase use projectID' to link to your firebase project

Use 'npm run build' to build the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Use 'firebase deploy' to deploy the project to the domain specified in Hosting/Dashboard
